# Vanilla

Vanilla (or Vanilla JS) is another appellation for the native Javascript core library, e.g. without any libraries. Other names are *Plain Old Javascript* or *Core Javascript*.

Usually, *Vanilla* only contains the core modules, but some people include also the *DOM API* which is only relevant in browser Javascript.
